Sample application demonstrating how to use Spring REST Docs with JUnit 5.

`SampleJUnit5ApplicationTests` makes a call to a very simple service and produces three
documentation snippets.

One showing how to make a request using cURL:

include::{snippets}/TeamController/selectAllTeam/curl-request.adoc[]

One showing the HTTP request:

include::{snippets}/TeamController/selectAllTeam/http-request.adoc[]

And one showing the HTTP response:

include::{snippets}/TeamController/selectAllTeam/http-response.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/TeamController/selectAllTeam/response-fields.adoc[]
